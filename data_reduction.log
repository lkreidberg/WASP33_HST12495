problem with offset -- need to account for POSTARG?
in old analysis of Heather's HD 97658b data, in zero_extract.py I wrote:
    "I AM SUBTRACTING 112 from the x coordinate in visit 0 to account 
    for difference in CRPIX2 in the direct image vs. scan"   

in WASP-33b data:
direct image:   CRPIX1  =  143.0 / x-coordinate of reference pixel    
grism:          CRPIX1  =  31.0 / x-coordinate of reference pixel

subtract 122 from spectral position in zero_extract.py
weird ... I get much better results if I subtract 112, rather than 122
 maybe there are 5 reference pixels on either side that are/are not being counted?
 I compared my wavelength solution with the G141 sensitivity curve, multiplied
 by  a stellar blackbody spectrum. It looks good to ~10 Angstroms

using offset of 112 for spectral direction direct image

reduction:
    window = 150; 07_11_10_45
    window = 250; 07_11_10_52

fitting first visit
best rms, redchi2 is 221 ppm , 17.18 for:
    myfuncs = ['constant', 'polynomial1', 'model_ramp', 'eclipse', 'sine2']


fitting spectroscopic lc with divide white:
    looks pretty good - some correlated noise. weird chi-square values
        (seem too low in some cases)


fit second visit
    having trouble getting least squares to find true minimum
    fixed fp on best fit from vis 1 white light (0.00140507) for divide white

two visits agree reasonably well

figured out why redchi2 values were too low! had incorrect number of data points
due to bug in read_data.py (since we aren't using all the data)

visit 1:
    made window smaller (50 pix), pretty good red chisq for white lc (rms = 152)
    better than larger windows (rms = 200+)
    30 pix window even better (rms = 142) ; 08_26_10_43
    explored using ackbar instead of model ramp -- not great
    20 pix window is wor se(rms = 167); 08_26_10_48
    tried model ramp fit to spectroscopic light curves - looks noisy
    
    tried to get better white light curve fit for visit 2  - moderate improvement

08/27/18:
fixed ephemeris to zhang value!
got a good fit to visit 1 white light curve!! yay
    model_ramp is much better than ackbar (170 vs 259 best fit rms)
whoa - second sine term very degenerate with eclipse depth! put higher limit on omega
got a decent fit with large omega - emission spectrum for 21 bins looks blackbodyish
    
divide white looks reasonable. 21 bins has more than expected scatter around BB
    11 bins looks fairly consistent with Haynes

pretty good fit to visit 2 white lc (rms = 212)

working on joint fit
    existing fit_par.txt gave better fit to white lc from vis_1!! (rms = 142 vs 163)

even better fit to visit 1! 134 ppm

joint fit is problematic. redo tomorrow!!!!

TODO:
    try fitting harmonic instead of two independent frequencies for sine wave
    compare spitzer eclipse depth
    try joint fit of both visits
